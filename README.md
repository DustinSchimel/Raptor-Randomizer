# Raptor Randomizer
Raptor Randomizer is a Java Applet that randomizes League of Legends champions, item builds, runes, summoner spells, etc.

  - Can be used with just the click of a button
  - Plans to be updated with each League of Legends patch

### Purpose
Raptor Randomizer is an applet that was inspired by a website called Ultimate Bravery. It randomizes the way you can play League of Legends and can make for a fun way to play with friends. This was made for an AP CSP project so I'm only a starting developer and this applet won't obviously be the best. But I hope you enjoy it anyway :)

### Installation
This app is currently being developed and is not at a state where I feel comfortable pushing a release. It will at least be ready in April of 2018.

### Todos
 - Complete design
 - Add random skill order
 - Add champion filter
 - ARAM and TT support
 - Ability to save builds
